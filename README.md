THIS is an API to Slack build in DART!

This is very simple yet and nothing is really implemented.

To run this will you need dart. You can get dart on https://www.dartlang.org/

Once you have dart on your sistem, you can run this API by typing 
/[path-to-dart]/dart-sdk-bin/dart main.dart


This little walkthrough will probably not work, so, You'll have to try something
else, or maybe not.

Cheers.
